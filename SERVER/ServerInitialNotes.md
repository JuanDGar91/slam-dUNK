##Original Source
[Click here](https://github.com/kaushikjadhav01/Online-Food-Ordering-Web-App) to visit kaushikjadhav's GitHub project we will be building off of.

##Details
The original application is a food ordering application that hosts a MySQL-based server to store data about orders.
We will repurpose this application so that the database's tables store data about coaches, athletes, their messages, and the coaches' announcements.
