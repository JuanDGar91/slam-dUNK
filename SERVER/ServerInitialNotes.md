## Original Source
[Click here](https://github.com/TheGreymanShow/web_application_using_sql) to visit TheGreymanShow's GitHub project we will be building off of.

The original application is a simple SQL web server application.
We will repurpose this application so that the database's tables
store data about coaches, athletes, their messages, and the coaches' announcements.
