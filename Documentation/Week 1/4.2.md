# Scope Statement, Milestones, Timeline, and Executive Summary for the Project

## Scope Statement
> loper slam dUNK is the custom sports software application for a UNK athletics team. loper slam dUNK makes it easy for coaches to announce communications to their athletes, schedule events for athletes to see, and randomly generate an athlete when needed. In short, the capabilities of loper slam dUNK assist coaches and athletes organize team members.
> We'll be making a computer application to accomplish what we outlined in our rough idea document. Below is what we will be doing and what we won't be doing

> - Allow the coach to make announcements/messages to their team.
> - Have a visible calendar to schedule games/practices.
> - Randomizer functionality for whatever the coach may need it for.
> - Use TKinter to make the GUI.
> - Create the GUI with multi-tab functionality (i.e., ability to switch between calendar, communication etc.)
> - Create a server to store data from the app on
> - Package the app into an executable
> - The app will not be available on mobile devices
> - Athlete-to-althlete communication will not be implemented
> - Calendar is coach use only
> - Notifications will not be implemented, althletes are required to check the app to see announcements

## An Executive Summary
> - Describe the problem, the process to solve the problem, the proposed solution, and the expected deliverables. Include security concerns.
> - Introduction: UNK athletic coaches encounter many different organizational needs. loper slam dUNK software makes team organization and communication easier and more fun! This software can be installed and run on a computer.

> - Software role and strength: loper slam dUNK is going to be a software catered towards a specific UNK athletics team. This way, the UNK team targeted by loper slam dUNK, has easier organizational abilities thanks to the loper slam dUNK software on their computer. Strengths include scheduling, visuals, randomization features, and communication capabilities.

> - The need/problem: Organizing an athletics team is hard. It is difficult to reach all athletes and get them in the right place at the right time. Especially when there are last minute changes and events! The lack of a communication platform and visual scheduler makes organizing athletes even more burdensome. Additionally, fairness is often questioned by athletes. A random generator can instill more trust in athletes when learning about the selection process. Additionally, a random generator eliminates any coach bias that may be present.

> - Unique solution: loper slam dUNK is the custom sports software application for a UNK athletics team. loper slam dUNK makes it easy for coaches to announce communications to their athletes, schedule events for athletes to see, and randomly generate an athlete when needed. This software can be installed and run on a computer.
