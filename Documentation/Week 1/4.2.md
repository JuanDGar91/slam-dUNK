4.2 - Next, you will create a Scope Statement, Milestones, Timeline, and Executive Summary for the Project
Scope Statement - A short document indicating what exactly you will do and what you will NOT do
Milestones - Key points in development wherein advancement can be marked. e.g. Creation of first prototype, first testing, iterations, etc.
A Timeline - Produce a graphical timeline that indicates milestones and when you meet them. Include security milestones
An Executive Summary - Describe the problem, the process to solve the problem, the proposed solution, and the expected deliverables. Include security concerns
Each of these documents must be well-formatted, concise, and professional. Avoid misspellings, bad grammar, and disorganization.  
These documents must be placed in your repo and linked to a Documentation index. e.g. create a readme.md in your Documentation directory 
and link all of your information there. You have total creative control here, so have fun!
