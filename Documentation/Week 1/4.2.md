# Scope Statement, Milestones, Timeline, and Executive Summary for the Project

## Scope Statement
> We'll be making a computer application to accomplish what we outlined in our rough idea document. Below is what we will be doing and what we won't be doing

> - Allow the coach to make announcements/messages to their team.
> - Have a visible calendar to schedule games/practices.
> - Randomizer functionality for whatever the coach may need it for.
> - Use TKinter to make the GUI.
> - Create the GUI with multi-tab functionality (i.e., ability to switch between calendar, communication etc.)
> - Create a server to store data from the app on
> - Package the app into an executable
> - The app will not be available on mobile devices
> - Athlete-to-althlete communication will not be implemented
> - Calendar is coach use only
> - Notifications will not be implemented, althletes are required to check the app to see announcements
