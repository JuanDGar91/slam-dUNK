# SETTING UP THE SQL PORTION OF OUR APPLICATION
Definition: According to Amazon Web Services, “Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational database.” 
For loperslamdUNK, the Microsoft SQL Server Manager is used. Tables were created in the SQL database. In order to write to that SQL database, we have created .py files for those tables. 

## Starting up SQL on Computer if you are a first-time loper slam dUNK user:
1. Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
2. If using windows, in search, type ODBC Data Sources. 
An ODBC User data source stores information about how to connect to the indicated data provider. A User data source is only visible to you and can only be used on the user's specific computer.
3. From ODBC Data Source, you can connect a Microsoft Access database to an external data source. In this case, use ODBC to connect to the Microsoft SQL Server.
