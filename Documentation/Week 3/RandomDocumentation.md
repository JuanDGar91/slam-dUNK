The Random Generator Feature of loperslamdUNK
## Purpose of the class coded
The purpose of the randomizer class is to randomly generate an athelte. At times, coaches need to make decisions that either (a) don't matter a ton, (b) need to be fair and impartial, or (c) both!
Having a random generator built-in to the app solves the problem for the coaches!
## Steps taken and any challenges 
The initial prototype and prototype 2 only had random generator abilities. This is because the random generator set some of the standard for how to code the application using tkinter.
Initially, all of the random generator functionality was on the main.py screen. We had to find a way to move functionality to a separate class. 
Then, when building the GUI, we had to connect the Random functionality to the buttons and features. 
Importing of classes was used. Additionally connection methods. Finally, outside Python-specific libraries were used (for example: random).
## Functionality Capabilities
At the top of the screen there is a entry box. A coach, player, or user can begin entering names into that entry box.
Each name entered will be then saved on a display screen below. Once all contenders/names have been entered by the user, the user clicks the
"SELECT RANDOM NAME FROM ABOVE" button. This button will randomly generate from the items entered into the list. The selection will be displayed in a message box.
## How to use the functionality on the loperslamdUNK application
