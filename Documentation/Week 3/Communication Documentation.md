# Purpose of the Communication class
> The main purpose of the class is to allow coaches to make announcements, and to allow the athletes to receive the
> coaches announcements. It does this by using a GUI to allow the user to interact with an SQL server that stores and
> fetches the announcements depending on the user.

# Steps taken and challenges
> To begin the class, we had to make the GUI for the user. This was not too challenging as using Tkinter is fairly straight
> forward. After that was implemented we added functionality by allowing the user to "send" an announcment that was initially
> saved to a list. The most difficult part was integrating the SQL server to the announcement functionality. Rather than save
> it to a list, the last iteration saves the announcement to a table, which can then be fetched if needed by the athletes. Because of this, the communcation class ended up being quite large as there was a lot to implement.
