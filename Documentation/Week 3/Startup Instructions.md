HOW TO STARTUP

DATABASE AND SQL PORTION:
Download Microsoft SQL Manager
Open up SQL Server Manager and connect to a server. The server type is a database engine. Then connect to your local machine using Windows Authentication (for Windows computers). 
Once connected, the top is the server that you are connected to and beneath the server there are a number of objects in folders. 
You can inspect columns and then see all the attributes in the columns 
You can edit and submit commands to the database engine using the query window
Go into Databases on the server, open databases, select or create the loperslamdUNK database
The cylinder is representative of a database. Once you open the database you can see Tables and the different tables. Tables help organize data and remove redundancies. Tables create relations and make sure there is less repeat in data (relational databases). 
You can right click and select the top 1000 rows
Depending on how many entries youâ€™ve created, the entries will display. For example, in the Coaches Table, the CoachID, the Name, the Description, the Username, and the Password data will be visible. Above the results panel is the query. A query can either be a request for data results from your database or for action on the data.

(B) RUNNING FROM PYTHON
Unzip the loperslamdUNK folder 
Configure an interpreter (may have to download version of Python)
Run the loperslamdunk.py. All necessary imports are within the loperslamdunk.py Python file. This Python file should display the GUI. The first part of the GUI that should appear is the sign in.

(C) RUNNING FROM EXECUTABLE
Select the loperslamdUNK.exe
Allow for open
