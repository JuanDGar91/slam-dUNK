all classes start with "Table_", and they have those getter and setter methods I mentioned. In terms of what's in the SERVER file, just ignore everything in there for the most part. Anything in there should be ran separately from the main program.

Hopefully this clarifies things a bit. Once we get the Event table's SQL code uploaded onto the GitHub I'll be able to make the Table_Event python file, aka the EventController which will have all the getter and setter methods we need.
