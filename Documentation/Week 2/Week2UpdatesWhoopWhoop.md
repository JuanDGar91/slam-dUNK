## Here are the week 2 updates 
1. Server decision changes 
I'm thinking that I will use another example server instead of that PHP server I pulled from the Internet. 
There are rather funky requirements for getting it all set up, and I think using the Python server I found would be substantially easier. 
It's a template for a licensing server, which will be great as all we really need from it is the code for a login and a way to 
communicate via HTTP requests to our SQL server. It's using an SQLite database, but that can easily be repurposed for SQL I think. 
Overall it has more that I can use for a login compared to just the PHP server I found. 
Is that alright if I begin implementing that? I'm fine if we talk about it more in class.
